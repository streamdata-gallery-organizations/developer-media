description: Developer Media&rsquo;s mission is to bridge the gap between advertisers,
  brand marketers, and the engineering community by guiding advertising creative in
  ways that will most appeal to engineers, by celebrating engineering and the contribution
  engineers make to the world and by making the whole process fun and engaging. We
  do this by creating the finest group of creative and technical minds and tasking
  them with building excellence in technical marketing, excellence in creative, excellence
  in technology, and excellence in the ad experience.
